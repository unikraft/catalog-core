# Testing the Unikraft ELF Loader (basic)

These are companion instructions to the main instructions in the [`README`](../../README.md) and to the scripted run instructions in the [`scripts/README`](../README.md).
Use these scripts to test the Unikraft ELF Loader (basic).

**Note**: Run scripts from the application directory.

Use the `all.sh` script to test all builds and all available runs:

```console
./scripts/test/all.sh
```

Logs are stored in the `./scripts/test/log/` directory.
